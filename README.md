# Solitaire_jump-and-take
Solitaire - 32 tokens to be reduced to one.
The original Solitaire - not repeat not Microsofts card game
Jump over one token into an empty field, remove the overleapt token.
Continue until no more moves are possible.
At best, one token will remain in the middle position (yes, it is possible!)

Room for improvement: Undo button, Reset (or Restart) button
